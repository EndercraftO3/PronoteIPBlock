# PronoteIPblock
Yeah I made this to block our own IP address. It's pretty fun to see people's reactions I guess.

# How to use :
I haven't made the interface that clean visually because it wasn't really the goal which is to make this functional but it should be easy to understand.


If you are not using CORS enabled mode, then automated mode will open a new window for you to run code in else it won't work because CORS.

If you have the CORS mode enabled (for example you used a CORS enabling extension) then the code will run locally and you have to press the stop automated mode for it to stop - it isn't instantaneous so you should wait around at most 30 seconds before you're sure the code exited.

The CORS toggle is located at the right.

The Pronote logo can also be used to check the banned state when you click it (CORS only). It autochecks until an error is encountered. If colored, then you are unbanned. If grey, then you are banned. If yellowish then an error happened.
The 1000 requests number isn't necessary, usually around 300-500 does the job but I never bothered to modify it :) I probably will when I find a small but reliable number.

Hope you enjoy (just don't openly do it in front of everyone !), it can be used to make people laugh or become a bit angry.
