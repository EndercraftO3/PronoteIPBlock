# PronoteIPblock
Yeah, I made this to block our own IP address. It's pretty fun to see people's reactions I guess.

# How to use :
I didn't make the interface that clean visually because that wasn't really the goal, which is to make it functional, but it should be easy to understand.

If you're not using CORS enabled mode, then automated mode will open a new window for you to run code in, otherwise it won't work because of CORS.

If you have enabled CORS mode (for example, you've used a CORS-enabling extension), then the code will run locally and you'll need to press the stop automated mode button to stop it - it's not instantaneous, so you should wait at most 30 seconds before you're sure the code has exited.

The CORS toggle is on the right.

The Pronote logo can also be used to check the forbidden state when you click on it (CORS only). It will automatically check until an error occurs. If coloured, you are not banned. If grey, you are banned. If yellowish, then an error has occurred.

The 1000 request number isn't necessary, usually around 300-500 does the job, but I never bothered to change it :) I might do it when I find a small but reliable number.


# Password
When you load the page, a password loop appears. This isn't for security, but to prevent inexperienced users from discovering and using the method, so it doesn't spread.

Hope you enjoy it (just don't do it openly in front of everyone!), it can be used to make people laugh or get a bit angry.
